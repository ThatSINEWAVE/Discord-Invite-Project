# The Discord Invite Project

Welcome to The Discord Invite Project! This repository serves as an educational and research platform exploring the concept of creating a database to track and analyze Discord invite links. 
The project aims to assist in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigations by providing tools to identify and study Discord servers, including potentially malicious ones.

## About the Project

The Discord Invite Project revolves around the idea of building a comprehensive database of Discord invite links for research purposes. 
By checking the Discord API, this database could potentially reveal valuable information about the creators of invites, server creators, and other metadata associated with Discord servers.

### Concept Status

As of now, The Discord Invite Project is in a conceptual phase. 
The primary challenge lies in the immense scale of data that would need to be stored and processed. 
The database's size is estimated to be over 2 petabytes, requiring substantial processing power to effectively manage and analyze.
